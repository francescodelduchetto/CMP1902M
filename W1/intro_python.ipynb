    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming, writing code, is the process of writing **instructions** in a structured format so that a computer can understand them and then follow them out (**execute** them). Most code also requires **data** of some kind, which is information that we store in the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: you might write a program that sends you a reminder a week before your assignment is due. Here are some *instructions* for this program:\n",
    "1. Find the current date (date1)\n",
    "2. Find the date of your assignment (date2)\n",
    "3. Check if the number of days between date1 and date2 is equal to 7...\n",
    " * ...and if so, show you the reminder\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to go from your abstract instructions in your mind, like the one above, to a program that can acually run on a computer you need a few other things to sort out. The first is the fact that you need to use a **programming language**, which can be seen as a *natural language* (like the one we used to define the program above), but one that computers can understand. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a wide variety of programming languages out there, some are very different from our *natural language* and required to express our instructions in a completely different way. Others, instead, are closer to the *natural language*. **You are in luck for this course**, we use the **Python 3** language, which belongs to the second group."
